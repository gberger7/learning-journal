day 4

Today, I learned about functions in JavaScript. I took my five individual questions and combined them into a function.  I also learned how to incorporate an array into that as well.  Our assignment today was to look over our partners code and correct any mistakes they may have made. Additionally, I also had to add functions in as well.
As part of the process today I also had to learn the process of cloning my partners project onto my computer, making corrections and adding functions to it, and then sending it back.

day 6

Today was honestly the hardest day of the class so far.  For the assignment, I was required to make a website for "Pat's Salmon Cookies. I was trying to get random amounts to pop up for a random amount of customers attending and cookies purchased each day for every hour, so whenever my website loaded it, it would generate a random number.  Although with some help I finally got part of it down, I left today feeling pretty overwhelmed and not completely understood, of the concept today.  The first day for week two did start off rough, but I am still very much enjoying the class and want to learn and get these concepts down.
