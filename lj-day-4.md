day 2

I learned a ton of helpful information today! One of the big things I learned was using an if/else statement. For the "about me" assignment, since had to come up with 5 questions yes and no answers, the if/else statement really helped a lot with that.

example:

JS

var answer1 = prompt('Hello! Is my name Gabe?').toUpperCase();
if (answer1 === "YES" || answer1 === "Y") {
  alert('That is correct my name is Gabe!');
  console.log('The user answered ' + answer1 + ' to whether my name was Gabe.')
}
else {
  alert('Sorry that is incorrect');
  console.log('The user answered ' + answer1 + ' to whether my name was Gabe.')
}

Also another very helpful thing I learned, was that using a "<div" tag instead of just a <h1> or <p> tag, helped me be able to add a border ,specifically, for around my <h1> and <p> tag.

example:

HTML

<div class="info">
      <h2>Personal info</h2>
      <p>My name is Gabe Altenberger and I am 19 years old from Brier, Washington.</p>
    </div>

CSS

.info {
  border: 2px solid black;
  width: 400px;
}

day 4

Today, I learned about functions in JavaScript. I took my five individual questions and combined them into a function.  I also learned how to incorporate an array into that as well.  Our assignment today was to look over our partners code and correct any mistakes they may have made. Additionally, I also had to add functions in as well.
As part of the process today I also had to learn the process of cloning my partners project onto my computer, making corrections and adding functions to it, and then sending it back.

day 6

Today was honestly the hardest day of the class so far.  For the assignment, I was required to make a website for "Pat's Salmon Cookies. I was trying to get random amounts to pop up for a random amount of customers attending and cookies purchased each day for every hour, so whenever my website loaded it, it would generate a random number.  Although with some help I finally got part of it down, I left today feeling pretty overwhelmed and not completely understood, of the concept today.  The first day for week two did start off rough, but I am still very much enjoying the class and want to learn and get these concepts down.  

day 9

Today my time in lab was spent refining my Salmon Cookie project.  I finished my table for the sales and did some css to add some borders around the amounts and totals.  I also started adding the chat in their as well, which still needs a lot of work.  However, today i ran into some problems which took much longer than I thought.  For today I had to add a footer to my table, which consisted of a "grand totals rows". Although this problem took a long time to figure out, I feel I learned a lot more than previous days through this problem.

day 10

My biggest accomplishment and thing I learned today, was making the submit button.  Like everyday in lab, I found this task to be quite difficult.  It took me some time getting this thing up and running.  However it turns out that for while my code was actually right for the most part, yet I had a couple very tiny misspelled words that through my whole code off.  

Day 13

Today I learned how to have three random images appear side-by-side and when clicked, three more pop up.  At the end of of 25 clicks, you cannot click anymore.  Overall, this lab was pretty difficult like all the labs.  I was really stuck on actually getting the random images to pop up different each time the window is clicked.  I eventually figured it out, but took quite some time.  
Hello

Day 14

Today I had to make three random pictures to appear and every time they are clicked.  What I learned was how to tally the votes as well as make sure the images don't duplicate and reappear the next click.

Day 15

Today I some classmates and I purposely had to create a merge conflict, and then figure out how to fix it. With our final projects coming up, there are potentials that a merge conflict could happen, so I thought this was a great exercise for us to learn this before the project starts.

Project Week Day 3

Through these first couple days, I have learned a ton of stuff.  It's been really cool to apply everything I have learned from lectures and labs to this project.  Often times in lectures and labs you are moving so fast you almost feel like you haven't learned anything.  However, I have noticed and been surprised in project week, of how much I have actually learned. I think one thing I have learned that has been encouraging to me, is that I feel I have gotten more of a hang of how to use CSS.  Before in labs it was a lot of guessing and hoping if something would work out, whereas I feel now, I almost know what I should do or change etc.
